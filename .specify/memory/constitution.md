# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics: A Hands-On Guide Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Audience-Centric Approach
All content, including text, diagrams, and code, must be created with a beginner-to-intermediate audience in mind. Concepts should be explained clearly and concisely, avoiding unnecessary jargon. The learning curve should be gradual and well-structured.

### II. Hands-On Learning First
The book is built around practical application. Every major concept must be accompanied by a hands-on mini-project or a practical example to reinforce learning. Theory should serve to support practice, not overshadow it.

### III. Visual and Clear Diagrams
Complex topics must be illustrated with clear, well-annotated diagrams. Diagrams are not optional; they are a primary tool for explaining concepts related to AI, robotics, and their interaction.

### IV. Modular and Project-Based Structure
The book's content should be organized into modular chapters that build upon each other. Each module should culminate in a mini-project that integrates the concepts learned.

### V. Docusaurus for Documentation
The entire book and its accompanying documentation will be built and maintained using Docusaurus. This ensures a consistent, searchable, and easily navigable online presence for the book.

### VI. Code Quality and Reproducibility
All code provided in the book must be well-commented, follow consistent style guidelines, and be easily reproducible by the reader. Required software and libraries must be clearly documented.

## Technology Stack

The primary technology for publishing the book is Docusaurus. All content will be written in Markdown. Diagrams will be created using a consistent tool and exported as SVG or PNG files.

## Content Development Workflow

Each chapter will go through a process of:
1. Outline and learning objectives.
2. Drafting of content and code for mini-projects.
3. Creation of diagrams and illustrations.
4. Technical review to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.
5. Editorial review for clarity and grammar.

## Governance

All contributors must adhere to the principles outlined in this constitution. Any changes to the constitution must be proposed and agreed upon by the project maintainers.

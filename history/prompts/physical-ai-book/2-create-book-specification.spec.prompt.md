based on the constitution create a detailed specification for the book physical ai and humanoid robotics include book structure with 5 chapters and 3 lessons  format, docusaurus -specific requirements for organization.

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created the detailed specification for the book "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics". The specification is based on the project constitution and includes the book structure with 5 chapters and 3 lessons per chapter, as well as Docusaurus-specific requirements. The specification file is located at `specs/physical-ai-book/spec.md`.

## Outcome
